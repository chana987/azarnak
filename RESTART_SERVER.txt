IMPORTANT: Restart your dev server!

The Astro configuration has been updated to enable server-side rendering.

To restart:

1. In your terminal where "yarn dev" is running, press Ctrl+C to stop the server
2. Run: yarn dev
3. Wait for the server to start
4. Visit http://localhost:4321

The error about Astro.request.headers should now be resolved!
